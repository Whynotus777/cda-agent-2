{"prompt": "What is the primary goal of cell placement in chip design?", "response": "The primary goal of cell placement is to determine the physical coordinates of all standard cells on the chip die to optimize three key metrics: (1) minimize total wirelength to reduce interconnect delay and power, (2) ensure routability by avoiding congestion, and (3) meet timing constraints by placing timing-critical cells strategically. A good placement enables efficient routing and directly impacts the final chip's performance, power, and area (PPA).", "phase": "placement", "category": "fundamentals"}
{"prompt": "Why is wirelength minimization important in placement?", "response": "Wirelength minimization is critical because: (1) Shorter wires have lower capacitance and resistance, reducing RC delay and improving timing. (2) Shorter wires consume less dynamic power during switching. (3) Less wire usage reduces routing congestion, making the design more routable. (4) Shorter wires are less susceptible to crosstalk and noise. The half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL) is commonly used as a proxy metric during optimization.", "phase": "placement", "category": "fundamentals"}
{"prompt": "Explain the difference between global placement and detailed placement.", "response": "Global placement determines approximate cell positions focusing on wirelength optimization and congestion minimization, but cells may overlap. Detailed placement refines these positions to: (1) remove all overlaps through legalization, (2) align cells to placement rows and sites, (3) fine-tune for wirelength and timing.

{"prompt": "What is placement density and why does it matter?", "response": "Placement density is the ratio of used area to available area in a region. Target density (typically 0.6-0.8) balances two competing needs: (1) Higher density (0.8+) places cells closer, reducing wirelength but increasing congestion. (2) Lower density (0.5-0.6) provides routing space but increases wirelength. Optimal density depends on design characteristics: logic-heavy designs can tolerate higher density, while interconnect-heavy designs need lower density for routability.", "phase": "placement", "category": "fundamentals"}
{"prompt": "How should I approach placement for a high-performance design?", "response": "For high-performance designs: (1) Use timing-driven placement that prioritizes critical paths. (2) Place timing-critical cells close together to minimize path delays. (3) Start with lower density (0.6-0.7) to allow flexibility for buffer insertion and cell resizing.

{"prompt": "How should I approach placement for a low-power design?", "response": "For low-power designs: (1) Minimize wirelength aggressively since wire capacitance dominates dynamic power.
